# DBMR_Coherence
Code for the paper: R. Polzin, I. Klebanov, N. Nüsken and P. Koltai, "Coherent set identification via direct low rank maximum likelihood estimation", 2024. 

The code uses the BMR-Toolbox of the Matlab-based software package described in the following paper: S. Gerber and I. Horenko, "Towards a direct and scalable identification of reduced models for categorical processes", PNAS, 2017. Link: https://github.com/SusanneGerber/Bayesian-Model-Reduction-Toolkit

The code uses the Matlab-based software package GAIO described in: M. Dellnitz, G. Froyland, and O. Junge. "The algorithms behind GAIO—Set oriented numerical methods for dynamical systems." In Ergodic theory, analysis, and efficient simulation of dynamical systems, pages 145–174. Springer, 2001. Link: https://github.com/gaioguy/GAIO
